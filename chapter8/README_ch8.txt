Audio Example 8.1 Audio examples of the $value sum of the total market, moment-to-moment
NB: Some of the audio files in the text are wrongly labeled in

- audio-8-1b.wav (wrongly labeled as audio-8-2b.wav in the text)
- audio-8-1c.wav (wrongly labeled as audio-8-3c.wav in the text)

Audio Example 8.2 Using simultaneous $value TRADEs to contribute to the composition of an evolving spectrum
- audio-8-2a.wav 
- audio-8-2b.wav


Audio Example 8.3 Three examples of cumulative TRADE data, with $value filters
- audio-8-3a.wav
- audio-8-3b.wav
- audio-8-3c.wav

Audio Example 8.4 Four examples of cumulative TRADE data with a shift in pitch to indicate whether the <price> of the following trade increased or decreased and to what extent. A higher pitch indicates that the price rose. Audio rendering occurs when cumulative $value >= $50 K. Time compression 1:60 (1 s = 1 min)
