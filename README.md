This repository contains additional materials for David Worrall's 2019 Springer book: 

"Sonification design: From data to intelligible soundfields", part of the Humanâ€“Computer Interaction Series (HCIS). 

The contemporary design practice known as data sonification allows us to experience information in data by listening.
In doing so, we understand the source of the data in ways that support, and in some cases surpass, our ability to do so visually.
The book is available as a book and in individual chapters.  For more details, see
