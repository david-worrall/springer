The files in this directory
---------------------------
- audio-9-1.wav	Audio Example9.1 An example of attentional listening. A nighttime pond chorus recorded by the author in 2013 at Tomakin, on the south coast of NSW, Australia.

- audio-9-2.wav Audio Example 9.2 Examples of some of the mapping strategies employed in the Netson network monitor

Extra File (not mentioned in the text):
--------------------------------------
- audio9.2andFig9-7.mp4  is a "screen-capture" movie from which the audio-9.2.wav file was derived. 
In general, red represents data leaving the node, blue, data receiving, cerise: unrecognized node.
This video demonstrates use of the simple user-interface to switch Netson into an "all addresses unrecognized" mode (cerise in the video) which invokes the glissando mapping of low-to-high indicating the data was leaving the intranet and distance to travel indicated by the duration of the tone. For incoming data, the mapping is reversed.
